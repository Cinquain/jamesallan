                Traditional thinking encourages us to slave ourselves. To win, you must wokr hard is 
                the adage. But is that an optimal viewpoint? While good old fashion hard work certainly
                has its place, we should not put it on a pedestal nor should make it a central focus of
                life. You are not put on this planet to work hard. You are here to live! 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Hard work is a part of life, a small part if anything. Life is much bigger than working hard
                to achieve some goal in order to prove yourself. There is no need to prove anything, greatness 
                is already within you, no matter how dormant it may seem. The question is not how do I become
                but <b> what do I want to be? </b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Between what you are now and what you want to be, there is a gap. The size of that gap varies 
                from person to person. The bigger this gap, the more "work" you have to do. There is two ways
                to tackle the challenge of becoming the ideal self. The first approach is to tackle it using
                brute force. You work really hard, you burn the midnight oil, you sacrifice your social life, 
                etc. The second, and certainly the one I advocate, is to approach this as a game. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The difference between these two approaches is not trivial. The first approach will kill the child
                in you. You will become strong but also a calloused individual lacking richness in personality. 
                Everything in life to you will be about a goal. You will only want to surround yourself with other 
                narrow minded goal driven individuals. Life to you will be a battle, a fight, something serious. You 
                will have "grown up".
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The second approach is to see things for what they are- a game. No matter what your journey here on
                earth is, you are heading in only one direction, <b> the grave</b>. You will die. Your life here is 
                a passing journey, a game.

                There are many different kind of games. Some are journeys of relationships, others are wild adventures,
                some games are horror movies, etc. Yes, games come in all genres and difficulty levels but they are
                still games nonetheless.

                The character you choose to play in this multiplayer game of earthlings is up to you, and forming this
                character is where all the fun is. Part of the process in forming this character is hard work, but don't 
                rely on that alone. They are techniques, tools, leverage, and hacks. Find them all, use them, and most 
                importantly, have fun!
