                As you reach higher levels of thoughts and physical vibrations, synchronicities begin to take place more often. Opportunities of all kinds come your way, people smile at you more often, and your thoughts manifest more quickly. It is tempting to view these synchronicities as unnatural but the truth is quite the opposite. Your life should be synchronous and coherent, not arbitrary and sporadic. Evolution means a life less dictated by fatalities and more guided by choice. After all, we live in a universe of laws not randomness.

                Many of you entering this new stage are not simply enjoying this new form of living, chances are, you are also wondering how you may accelerate this process. In other words, you want to raise your vibrations so that you can live an even more consciously created and controlled life. While you may never reach the level of absolute control over nature (Only God has power), the degree in which you may take active charge of your life would absolutely baffle most people.

                There are highly spirited people on this planet that experience very little gap between what they mentally visualize and what we call reality. If you are seeking to raise your vibrations to such levels, then this article is for you. Ok, now let’s begin.

               Balance Your Energy Centers

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                At this current stage of humanity’s evolution, most people are absolutely horrendous at managing the energy in their physical system. They dissipate power at practically all centers. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        

        <div class="paragraph">

                The body has seven major energy centers, some call them chakras. These are major organ points where a lot of bioactivity is performed. Your brain is the crown chakra, your pineal gland is the third eye, the neck is the throat chakra, the heart is the chest chakra, the stomach, intestines, and enteric nervous system make up the stomach chakra, the ovaries or testes are the sex chakra, lastly, the kidneys and adrenals are your root chakra.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Mismanagement of any of these energy centers first leads to a drain in health and intelligence, but eventually results in disease. Dissipation tendencies tend to vary across individuals. What is true for the individual is also true for the collective. Different cultures have different dissipation tendencies as well. From my personal observation, the modern man or woman excessively dissipates energy at the crown, stomach, and sex chakra. 
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                There are also people whom I refer to as the half wise. These are people who have identified dissipation at one particular point such as the sexual center but completely miss the ceaseless dissipation people perform through speech and useless thinking. Dissipation whether done at the positive polarity (the mind) or the negative popularity (the sex organ) is still dissipation. Both equally drain you of health, strength, vigor, and intelligence. 
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                While dissipations are extremely common, blockages are also a frequent occurrence. Many people have heart and root blockages. They live an unauthentic life and are paralyzed by fear. Heart blockages kill more people than any of the ceaseless dissipation people perform on a daily basis.

                The proper management of the body’s energy system is not something I can cover in a simple article. However, a good axiom I give my students is to watch where their energy is going. This self observance with a mindfulness of energy will reveal your dissipation pattern more than anything else. 
                Once you identify where your vitality is being drained, change it accordingly. I have also written a <a href="../book.html">short guide</a> on how to better manage the energy in your system. Once you learn how to conserve and direct energy, you can use that power to beautify your body and mind.
