                For the past few years, Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies have been on fire. From seemingly out
                 of nowhere, what was once an obscure technocrats’ dream now has thousands of evangelizers shouting 
                 its glory. While I try to avoid bandwagons, the false confidence Bitcoin has gained aroused me to 
                 write an article on the matter. I do not wish to spend much time on the subject so I will briefly 
                 explain why Bitcoin will fail. It does not require special foresight to predict Bitcoin’s gloomy 
                 future. Most of this stuff is common sense once a fundamental understanding of money is grasped.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Before discussing Bitcoin, it is vital we cover the difference between currency and money. Let’s 
                start by defining money. Money is a store of value. This brief definition is not overly simplistic,
                but precisely accurate. Anything that is an asset is money. Although we know that money is an asset,
                we often fail to realize that all assets are also money. Your house, your car, your phone, your TV,
                most importantly, your skills, are all money.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                A currency on the other hand, <b> is money that has become an accepted medium of exchange. </b> 
                Currencies do not come out of the void, they were first regular everyday assets. However, what
                makes one asset become currency over a thousand others is the key to understanding the future 
                failure of bitcoin.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                An asset is eligible to become currency if and only if it fulfills a universal need. Since everyone
                needs this asset either now or in the near future, that particular asset circulates rapidly enough
                to become currency. This explain why for most of history, the assets that became currency were 
                consumable commodities. Money was rice in Japan, wheat in Egypt, Salt in Celtic Europe, etc. 
                Looking at it from this perspective, we see that currency is a natural element. <b>It is the most 
                rapidly circulating commodity of a period. </b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Bitcoin in and of itself does not fulfill a universal human need. This point is self evident because
                you cannot consume a Bitcoin nor can you utilize it alone without a counter-party. Since Bitcoin is
                not a standalone asset, it is not money. It can be argued however, that although Bitcoin does not 
                fulfill a biological need, it does have value in the domain of monetary exchange. This argument is 
                valid- <b> but only if Bitcoin succeeds as a social network like the U.S dollar did. </b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                All social networks are inherently worthless and Bitcoin is no different. What gives them value are
                the users participating. This implies that the future of Bitcoin is dependent on its success as a 
                social network. Unfortunately, Bitcoin is not being mass adopted by mainstream. It is becoming a
                tool for speculation by an elite few rather than a medium of exchange for the proletariat. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                This transformation of Bitcoin into a speculative instrument has ruined its possibility to be adopted 
                by mainstream merchants. That is because it is impossible to price consumer goods in such a volatile 
                currency. The ever changing price of Bitcoin also makes it painstakingly difficult for merchants to 
                settle accounts. Stability is one of the key elements of money, an attribute Bitcoin does not possess. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Overall, Bitcoin is a positive movement gone horribly wrong. This negative direction has been fueled 
                by speculators arousing a desperate population seeking to acquire wealth without dutiful labor. 
                Fortunately, there is no royal road to success, not for you, not for Bitcoin.
