                So you’ve been suffering from acid reflux for months if not a year + now. You have blamed all sorts of food as the culprit such as coffee, gluten, lactose, you name it. You’ve tried everything yet still the acid reflux keeps returning. You are now becoming desperate for an answer, wondering if this is how the rest of your life will be. Well worry not, there is no such thing as a causeless effect, so there is an answer. It is my wish now to share what I have learned with you.
            </p>

                The condition you are dealing with is the cumulative result from years of wrong living. What if I told you that the burning effects you are experiencing are a result of a yeast infection? That’s right! You have a fungus overgrowth that is fermenting carbohydrates- causing the burning sensation you experience during the day, but most especially at night. Many people do not connect candida yeast infections to heartburns, but this fungal infection can result in that and much more. In fact, candida yeast infection is the deep underlying problem for many chronic conditions, including autoimmune disease.

                When you eat too much carbohydrates and sugar without fiber, you are feeding the candida, causing it to ferment. This fermentation causes gas which results in bloating and reflux . In order to get rid of this issue, you must adopt a low carb diet and stay away from any food that contains yeast. A simple axiom to follow is to avoid any sugar that does not have the fiber to help your digestive system properly process it. Sugar without fiber (processed foods) will quickly enter your bloodstream, taxing your pancreas and feeding the yeast infection. Here is a list of foods to avoid: 
            </p>
            </div>
        <br>



        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                • Sugar & Sugar Substitutes <br>
                • Bread & Crackers (they are high carbs and contain yeast)  <br>
                • Limit Fruits (especially oranges, they contain yeast)                <br>
                • Carbonated Drinks such as sodas and energy drinks                <br>
                • Processed Food (that includes white rice)                 <br>
                • Limit Dairy (Afterall, lactose is a sugar)               <br>
                • No Alcohol (alcohol is a product of yeast fermentation, they have yeast)                <br>
                • Limit Smoking (especially if the infection reaches your throat)                 <br>
                • Smoking Ciggs & Joints (Switch to Vaping to prevent esophagus damage)<br>
                • Peanut Butter or Cashew Butter (almond butter is ok) <br>
                • Greasy Foods <br>
                • Spicy Foods <br>
                • Juicing of any kind. (Juicing removes fiber from the sugar of the fruits) <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                I cannot stress the importance of eating a low carb ketogenic diet. The heavy carbs are what feed the fungal infection. The first step in recovering is starving the fungus. You achieve this by decreasing the amount of carbs you consume and increasing your physical movement. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                To sum it up into a simple heuristic- avoid acidic, spicy, and processed foods during your recovery period. Acidic food tears up your stomach lining, and processed foods like sugar causes more inflammation. Spicy foods seem to irritate the wound and cause unbearable pain. Avoid all three at all costs. Beet juice is also a good anti-inflammatory drink to help speed your recovery. I recommend this restricted diet for a period of at least 30 days to let your stomach lining fully recover. Feel free to extend that period if you feel that your stomach lining needs more time. Listen to your body, it will tell you when it's ready.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The gas fermented by the fungus creates pressure in your stomach. This pressure pushes the stomach acid back up your esophagus, creating heartburns. The acid reflux is especially vicious at night because the pulling force of gravity isn’t there to protect you. Since there is constant gas in your stomach from fermentation, having a full stomach increases the pressure even more, creating a more serious reflux. I recommend eating just two meals a day, with the evening meal taken at 5pm the latest. I also recommend plenty of movement to facilitate digestion and decrease the pressure in your stomach. So walk at least 2 miles a day. 
                The last step you must take is the consumption of agents that actively fight the yeast infection. There are many herbs and supplements for this. Here are a few that I recommend:

                • Garlic <br>
                • Algae  <br>
                • Oregano Oil               <br>
                • Ginger               <br>
                • Lime or Lemon Juice                <br>
                • Pomegranate               <br>
                • Olive Oil               <br>
                • Cabbage               <br>
                • Greek Yogurt (Plain non-sweetened)               <br>
                • Yeast Cleanser Pills (Optional) <br>

                There are a number of articles on the internet that promote strange insane diets that literally starve you by discouraging the consumption of any carbohydrates. These diets are not only strange but impractical. Your body needs carbohydrates, you cannot eliminate them completely. There is also the fact that some fruits like pineapple or pomegranates do help fight candida and can therefore be consumed. The goal is to reduce your carbs, especially unhealthy processed non-fibrous ones, but you should not eliminate the whole food block altogether.

                It is important to understand that this bacterial overgrowth results in a number of issues, not just acid reflux. As the infection spreads, it reaches your nerves and bloodstream and different organs. This spreading causes the bacteria to cause skin reactions, dandruffs, leaky gut, urinary tract infections, sugar sensitivities, lactose intolerance, and ultimately an autoimmune disorder. Do not make the mistake of overlooking the potential problems this can cause. Take this infection seriously.

                To summarize, the road to health and sleepful nights involves reducing your carbohydrate intake to just 25% or less of your food consumption. Avoid food with yeast altogether such as most bread. The only bread you can have are non-yeast bread like sourdough or flatbread.  Decrease your food consumption to allow your stomach to experience less pressure, giving you a significant decrease in acid reflux pain. Be sure to walk two miles a day to help with digestion. Lastly, take herbal supplements to combat the yeast infection while you starve it with your reduced carb intake. For your stomach to reach its normal balance, time is required. Expect full recovery to take anywhere from a week to six months. Once you’ve recovered, please do not return to a carb heavy diet. Again, stay away from non-fibrous sugars like processed foods or juicing. Maintain your healthy lifestyle.
