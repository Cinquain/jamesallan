                2020 was a tough year for everyone. While some people battled a job loss or an economic shutdown, I battled gastritis. My experience during this ordeal was extremely painful but also very enlightening. It revealed to me years if not decades of mistakes masked by youth. As one ages into adulthood, the healing time required extends, and this longer recovery exposes many lifelong habits that were always mistakes but appeared ok on the surface due to regenerative powers of youth. A very poignant lesson that I’ve learned from this experience is that disease is not an accident, it is the culmination of years if not decades of error.

                It took a year and a half of experimenting through trial and error to completely get rid of gastritis. Many of these lessons were learned through suffering. It is my wish therefore to share what I have learned so that those suffering from a similar illness can cure themselves quicker and with much less suffering. Let’s start with the basics and proceed onto solutions.

            <h2>What is Gastritis</h2>
        </div>



        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Gastritis is a condition where the lining of your stomach is inflamed. This creates extreme sensitivity which can become incredibly painful when contact is made with certain foods. How you got this inflammation in the first will vary amongst individuals. For me, it was the result from decades of eating acidic foods and having coffee in the morning on an empty stomach. The deterioration of my stomach lining also resulted in the opportunistic bacteria H. Pylori to cause an infection. Overall, I had a damaged and inflamed stomach lining as well as a bacterial infection. The causes for your case however may be different. You will have to do your own soul searching to find the many culprits (It is hardly ever one thing). Regardless of what the causes are, your stomach lining is now damaged and inflamed so you now must give the stomach a period and environment where it has the space to heal. You can call it a stomach recovery program. Let’s begin with what foods to avoid.

                Your body has an important biofeedback mechanism to let you know what foods to avoid during your healing period- it’s called pain. Pain is the signal that this food disturbs your inflamed stomach. After much trial and error, these are the foods I've learned to avoid at all costs.

                To sum it up into a simple heuristic- avoid acidic, spicy, and processed foods during your recovery period. Acidic food tears up your stomach lining, and processed foods like sugar causes more inflammation. Spicy foods seem to irritate the wound and cause unbearable pain. Avoid all three at all costs. Beet juice is also a good anti-inflammatory drink to help speed your recovery. I recommend this restricted diet for a period of at least 30 days to let your stomach lining fully recover. Feel free to extend that period if you feel that your stomach lining needs more time. Listen to your body, it will tell you when it's ready.

            <p>
                So time has gone by and you feel that you are ready for acidic food again, whether that be coffee, wine, or dark chocolate. Now that your stomach lining has healed, you feel like you can go back to your old habits again- wrong!  Remember, it was those habits that gave you gastritis in the first place. Going back to them will only return you to such hell.

               <b> The most important lesson you must take from this experience is that you have to balance your acidic food with alkaline ones. </b> In other words, you must have healthy food combinations. If you do not balance your meals, your acidic diet will rip your stomach lining again. A tragedy I’m sure you do not want to repeat.
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Here is how to balance your diet: 1) Take note if the food that you are eating is acid producing or alkaline. 2) Balance every acidic food with an alkaline counterpart. 3) Never have acidic drinks like coffee, energy drinks, or soda on an empty stomach.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Now let’s take this theory into practice by demonstrating a few real life examples. Coffee is acidic. Instead of having it alone, you can balance the coffee by having it with high quality cheese. Although it has a ph of 5, cheese is actually alkaline forming. Meat is also an acid producing food. You can neutralize it by having meat with sweet potatoes or vegetables. Processed foods like sugar or refined bread directly cause inflammation. The best way to deal with them is to severely minimize their intake or avoid them altogether. Use whole wheat bread and brown sugar instead. How you work out your food combinations and portions is up to you, as long as you ultimately balance your diet to a neutral or slightly alkaline ph. That- is the main lesson.

                I hope this article finds you with goodwill. It is my sincere wish that you use the information here to stop pain and heal your stomach lining. Remember that after your acid and processed free dietary period, you must balance the ph of your meals. Only that will prevent the inflammation from reoccurring. Protons inhibitors are simply an artificial method of achieving the same thing, albeit one with side effects.
