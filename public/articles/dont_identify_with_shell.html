                   Society has interesting ways of classifying people. The two most common ones are social class and 
                   shell types. Class can be broken down into education, income, and profession. Shell types
                   are broken into sexual orientation, skin color, and size. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                    It is clear that an individual may traverse across income brackets, so as a rule, people don't 
                    personally identify with social class. An ignorant man can become educated, a poor person can become
                    rich, and an engineer can become a doctor. Hence, although social class can create friction, it
                    isn't closely tied to identity. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                    When it comes to shell types however, people often invest their personal identity towards it. They believe
                    their physical appearance are part of the I. <b>DO NOT</b> make this mistake. A close examination will show
                    you that your body is something you own, not something you are. 
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                    Your body is a bag of chemicals. Depending on the chemical proportions, it will exhude 
                    different features and pigmentation. In the past, this chemical proportion was rigidly controled 
                    by nature. The environment regulated your biochemistry through a feedback loop.
                    This bio-environmental loop has been going on since man existed and is still occuring today. It would be
                    naive for you to think that the Greeks of Aristotle are the same as the Greeks today. 
                    What people call race is not static but rather an ever evolving
                    thing, like all else on earth.

            <p>
                    Other than the fact that nature is ever molding the human biological shell, there is another coming
                    and even more powerful factor we ought to consider- knowledge. It will not be long before technical
                    innovation and scientific knowledge allow us to control and manipulate our body's chemical
                    proportions and genetic sequencing.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                    In the not so distant future, a person will be able to choose his or her race at will and change it
                    at any point similar to how we do so in video game avatars. Better yet, an individual will not only be
                    able to choose his or her 'race', but they will be able to create new ones. People will 
                    experiment with different genetic sequencing, different physical features, and different 
                    character traits. Ultimately, there will come a point where humans will choose not to have a 
                    shell altogether. We will find its limitations too cumbersome for deep space exploration.

                    Now... I am not saying not to value your body. On the contrary, take pride in your shell, whatever
                    it may be. Strengthen it, beautify it, improve its posture and countenance, make it more glorious! 
                    It is your duty to show how wonderful the human body can be. Push beauty to the limit! However... 
                    do not identify with the bioshell, it is not you. You are a spirit.
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                   Observe your body over the years, it has changed hasn't it? Your body will continue to change... and
                   one day, that garment will return to the host planet you're on- earth. Don't take the game of shell
                   classification seriously. It is but a passing stage in human evolution no matter how untrue this statement may 
                   appear. Remember the glorious spirit that you are, and don't forget to play while you're here on earth.
