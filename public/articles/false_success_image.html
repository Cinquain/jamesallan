        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Society would like us to believe that success lies in material things.  A little reflection actually 
                shows otherwise. Material success is low on the scale of life’s riches. Money cannot purchase strength,
                valor, beauty, intellect, peace of mind, dignity, love, or friendship. These are life’s true riches, 
                but they are earned not purchased.  Why aren’t our leaders promoting these virtues?
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                The elite network of today are banking cartels. Their main product, which they print out of thin 
                air as some of you know, is paper money. Their ceaseless promotion of money as sole measure of 
                success is simply a way to push their product. In the past, religion was oversold to the public. 
                People sacrificed their entire happiness for a future life promised by an elite priesthood. In 
                today’s world, the same is being done with money.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Since the mainstream elite will not paint a more holistic picture of success, I will humbly make a 
                suggestion. My hope is to provide an intangible force that can counterweight dollars. Success… true 
                success, has both an individual and collective component. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                On an individual level, success can be measured through self development. Have you improved or degenerated?
                A successful person is someone who has positively evolved. They have become stronger, smarter, more 
                courageous, more intelligent, more physically beautiful, etc. In other words, <b>they are now a more sophisticated
                life-form</b>. Evolution is real, and your progress is measured by what plane of life you occupy. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                 On a collective level, success implies an addition to collective knowledge or a physical advancement to the 
                 human race. An athlete setting a new world record is equally important for collective advancement as the 
                 scientist discovering a new law of nature. On a less grandiose level, the human species can be improved by 
                 cultivating superior morals. Are you adding to the collective hate and fear around us or are you filling your 
                 heart with love and courage?

                This article is not about demonizing money, it has its place. However, society needs forces that counterweight 
                dollars. It is not how much stuff you have collected that ultimately matters but what you have become.
