                Most people view chakras as mystical fancies. Even amongst those with a spiritual inclination, 
                chakras are seen as ethereal elements, devoid of practical applications. I would like to present 
                a more grounded approach to this topic. It is my aim to show that chakras are tangible elements,
                 with complete application in our daily affairs.
            </p>

                The seven chakras are major energy points in your body. In a more physical sense, chakras are zones
                of high bioactivity. Your crown chakra is your brain, an organ that consumes more than a quarter of 
                your bioenergy. The chest chakra is your heart, an organ that works ceaselessly to pump blood throughout 
                your body. Those that doubt that there is a throat chakra should merely touch their neck to see how much 
                heat circulates in this region. People wear scarves for a reason. Your sex chakra are your gonads, a heat
                zone that produces sperm and maintain ovaries, ect. One can see therefore that chakras are real biological 
                centers, not spiritual fiction. This realization leads us to our next topic, how to apply them.

                Proper management of your centers is vital. That is because mismanaging them leads to illness, degeneration, 
                or both. Many people have accelerated their biological age due to the mismanagement of their energy. Some 
                people abuse their throat chakra by speaking too much. Others abuse their sex chakra, creating disturbances 
                that affect their heart and psyche.

                The same is true in the other direction however. That is, intelligently managing your chakras blooms your mind 
                and body. A person who is neither overextending nor contracting any of their chakras is glowing with life. 
                That is because energy is circulating throughout their entire body, rather than being congested or dissipated 
                at one or more point.

                I have written a book on how to manage energy to rejuvenate your mind and body. It is a synthesis of
                painful lessons I have learned over the years. It contains knowledge I wish possessed when I was 19.
