                Success is not simply a matter of working hard. Many people work hard but are not receive high 
                monetary rewards for it. Yet there are others who hardly seem to work but are making a financial
                killing. We have all encountered this scenario and the conclusion most often reached is that
                life is unfair. I urge you to probe deeper. There is more than meets the eye here. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Financial wealth is not a function of working hard, it is a function of services rendered. 
                When we remain within ethical boundaries, the difference between the commoner and financial elite is the <b>amount</b> of
                services rendered. To put it in layman's terms, a wealthy person is someone who has rendered services to 
                alot more people. <b>The way to achieve this is by scaling and drying up your work.</b> 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                To explain what I mean by scaling and drying, I will use the fictional story of a carpenter who rises from common laborer to multi 
                millionaire. This simple illustration will shed more light than any intellectual definition that I can give.

                We start with a man named Gomez. He is a construction foreman and very skilled carpenter. Gomez 
                works for a real estate company and is in charge of constructing the frame and roofing of houses.
                For his carpentry and contruction foreman skills, the company pays him $90,000 a year, a respectable salary.
                However, as a carpenter, Gomez can only work on one house at a time. No more than that! The work is difficult
                and certainly value producing, <b>but the amount of people Gomez can render services is limited to one client- 
                his employer. 
                </b>  
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Gomez is tired of corporate ceilings on top of overworking, he decides to leave the company he works at to open
                up a school. He has decades of experience teaching men and women the fine skill of carpentry and has learned
                from the field that the marketplace lacks decent schools. Gomez opens up a school which charges $20,000
                to learn carpentry for nine months. He personally teaches the classes himself and spends eight hours a day with his
                students. He enrolls 30 students in the first year. The second year he enrolls 50.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Gomez went from making $90,000 a year after a decade working for an employer to making $1,000,000 the second year 
                he has been teaching others. What happened? The answer is simple, <b>scaling!</b> Previously, Gomez was rendering services 
                to only one entity- the employer. Now he his rendering services to 50 individuals. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Although certainly an improvement from the daily grind, teaching can be quite tiring and <b> it is certainly
                a repetitive job. </b> Our carpenter friend is repeating himself once every nine months. It is also very 
                likely that he finds himself repeating the same thing across different courses within that nine months. 
                Carpentry is a field dominated by principles and mathematical laws that won't change. Most of the material
                Gomez finds himself repeating in each class probably won't change in the next 20 years. What's the point of
                repeating the thing that has been said nine months ago. Repetitive work is for machines, 
                humans are meant to live unique interesting lives. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Gomez knows he can do better. He begins recording his classes. Over time, he builds a collection of 
                his best recording sessions. He compiles that library into an online course, and begins making it available
                for sale via the web. Not only does Gomez no longer need to repeat himself, millions now have access to his 
                teachings online. Gomez sells his carpentry fundamentals course for $60 via the internet. He sells an 
                average of 3,000 courses per year, approaching close to $200,000 annually. Gomez no longer needs
                to work! This was an example of DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself). <b>Drying up your life means doing work 
                once and getting paid for it over an extended period. </b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Since Gomez no longer does the repetitive work of teaching, he now has free time. Instead of vacating at 
                the Bahamas, our young carpenter is ambitious. He wants to spread his
                techniques throughout the world for he is convince it will make construction safer and more effective. 
                Over the past decades of working and teaching, he has been exposed to countless repeating themes in regards 
                to what methods work in the field and what forms mature capable carpenters. He decides to write
                a book! 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Writing a book is perhaps the DRY(est) work one can do. Writing a book is the art of synthesizing  
                repeating experiences into an abstraction that can be used as a reliable principle. Gomez only has to write a book 
                once, but if it is going to be a good one, it will take time. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                It took Gomez 15 full months of deep thoughts to complete his book. He decides to self publish through Amazon
                and collects a royalty of $7 per sale after taxes and distribition. When the book is released, he sells 700,000
                copies within the first month. He has made $4.9 million dollars for work he never has to repeat. More importantly,
                the book will continue to sell over the years, and Gomez will continue to get paid. <b>The selling of books
                is an example of scaling and drying. </b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
    
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                To prevent moral hazards, it is important I mention that repetition <b>DOES</b> have a 
                place in nature. You cannot properly abstract something until you have mastered it, and mastery requires repetition.
                Therefore, <b>DO NOT </b> try to skip steps. Don't be like the foolish who tries to sell abstractions without 
                previous long tested experience to back it. You must pay your dues as they say. Start at the bottom, as a laborer.

                Did you know that when it snows, each and every snow flake is unique. Nature never repeats herself. We should strive 
                to become like her. We are not here on earth to live a conveyor belt lifestyle but to have unique experiences. DRY is a 
                concept I've learned from programming. It is short for Do Not Repeat Yourself. While every programmer strive to write 
                dry code, people should strive to live DRY lives. Stop doing repetitive work. Machines can do that, and at some point- 
                <b>they will.</b>
