                We all know that a class or struct can have functions and variables inside them. The functions inside 
                these objects are called methods, while their variables are called properties. To access the method or 
                property of a class or struct, you first need an instance created.

                There are cases however, where we want to access a property or method without the need for creating an 
                instance. Such property or method would not belong to a particular instance, but to the class or struct
                 itself. These elements are called type method or type property. They are prefixed with type because they 
                 belong to the data type itself, not a particular instance. To create a type method or property, use the 
                 static or class keyword in front of the variable or function you want to belong the data type.

                The code example above uses the static keyword to create its type properties. Using the <b>static</b>keyword 
                means that the type method or property is not inheritable when the data type is subclassed. Therefore 
                both structs and classes can use the <b>static</b> keyword.

            <p>
                If you use the class keyword such as in the case above, it means that the type method or property can be 
                inherited when the data type is subclasses. Using the class keyword also means the type method can be 
                overridden. Since structs do not have inheritance ability, only classes can use this keyword as shown in 
                the compiler error.

                The last thing I want to mention is that type properties and methods are lazy by default. That is 
                because they are global variables. In Swift, all global variables are implemented using lazy loading 
                without needing to write the lazy keyword. This is an important point and is often overlooked by developers.
                It implies two things. First, that the initial value is not calculated until the type property is called. 
                Second, that the type property can only be called once. To illustrate this point, I will create a code example
                using a random generator. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>

                The example above demonstrate a generator function which returns a random number when itâ€™s called. 
                The function is called twice after being created. Each time it is a called, the function returns a
                different random number as expected.   
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                In this example, we store an identical generator function inside a type property. However, calling
                 the function on multiple occasions gives us the same result. That is because global variables are 
                 implemented using lazy loading, and lazy loading implies that the property can only be called once. 
                 The generator function was called during the first execution. After the first call, the lazy property 
                 simply stores the previously returned value.
            </p>

                In a nutshell, type methods or properties are elements that belong to the data type, not a particular instance.
                 Hence why they have type as part of their name. Because they are global variables, Swift implements them using
                lazy loading despite the absence of the lazy keyword. Lazy loading means the initial value is not computed until 
                the property is called, and that it can only be called once. This summary gives you a solid footing on type 
                properties/methods and set you up to understand the singleton design pattern. Til next time!
